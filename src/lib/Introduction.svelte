	<p>
		For Christian students, psychology class can be one of the more challenging classes they
		take in college. What did they teach you in Psych 101? Prepare your kids now, before
		they go to college. Introduce them to the study of God’s grandest creation – the human
		mind – from a distinctly Christian perspective. Help them understand that when it comes
		to psychology, the Christian worldview makes sense.
