<h1>Welcome to Homeschool Psychology</h1>

<section>
	<p>
		For Christian students, psychology class can be one of the more challenging classes
		they take in college. What did they teach you in Psych 101? Prepare your kids now,
		before they go to college. Introduce them to the study of God’s grandest creation –
		the human mind – from a distinctly Christian perspective. Help them understand that
		when it comes to psychology, the Christian worldview makes sense.
